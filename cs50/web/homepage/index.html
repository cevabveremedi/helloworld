                and hotly, bringing disparity into the cold and dark world. It is in this First flame, that the four souls of Lords are found. 
                These souls are massively powerful. granting those that hold them god-like power, and thereby dominion in this new world.

                burning the arch-trees, the homes of the dragons. Nito unleashed death and disease upon the dragons, and their bodies crumbled away in the miasma.

                <span class="tab"></span>The Lords' domain came to be known as Lordran, the land of the Lords, and many human lands began to spring up and flourish around it. 
                For many centuries, or perhaps even millennium, these civilizations grew, and the people loved and feared the Lords, who lived as gods in the city of <span class="linkText" onmouseover = "show('img7')" onmouseout="hide('img7')"><img src="img/anor_londo.jpg" id="img7" class="ghostImage">Anor Londo</span>.

Much of his army followed him here, and when the flame rekindled, they were burned to ashes, leaving behind only suits of armour that now wander the world.

            <p class="blockContent">
                <span class="tab"></span>For defying the coming Dark, Gwyn somehow proliferates the Undead Curse. It is not exactly clear how this curse came to be, but its effects are catastrophic. When one becomes Undead, they are marked by the accursed Darksign. Their bodies slowly decay, and upon death they are reborn from Bonfires, shrines to the First Flame. Slowly, over many deaths, Undead begin to Hollow, becoming more savage and less intelligent.
                <br>
                The people of the world almost universally feared and hated those cursed with <span class="linkText" onmouseover = "show('img13')" onmouseout="hide('img13')"><img src="img/undead.jpg" id="img13" class="ghostImage">undead</span> and built an Asylum in the far North, where they sent the Undead to await the end of the world. It is here, a thousand years after Gwyn linked the First Flame, that the <span class="linkText" onmouseover = "show('img14')" onmouseout="hide('img14')"><img src="img/Chosen_undead.png" id="img14" class="ghostImage">Chosen Undead</span> is found, and the events of Dark Souls take place.
